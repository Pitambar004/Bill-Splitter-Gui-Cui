# Bill Splitter Application --- Python & Tkinter

This repository contains a simple, user-friendly **Bill Splitter
Application** built entirely in **Python**, featuring both a
**Tkinter-based GUI** and a **non-GUI console version**. The project is
designed to help users split bills accurately while practicing core
Python logic and interface development skills.

## 📌 Features

-   GUI built with **Tkinter**
-   Console (non-GUI) version included
-   Tax calculation support
-   Vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian bill splitting
-   Fair distribution of meat-item costs
-   Input validation & error handling
-   Clean layout with padding and spacing

## 🧮 How It Works

1.  User enters subtotal (before tax)
2.  User enters tax percentage
3.  User enters number of people
4.  App asks if there are vegetarians
5.  If yes, user enters meat item total
6.  Meat costs are split among non-vegetarians only
7.  Remaining costs (including tax) are split equally
